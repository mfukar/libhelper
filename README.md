## What is this?

libhelper is a library of various tools which are often reinvented by C programmers,
because they are not part of the standard library. It aims to collect frequently used
constructs, algorithms, and helpers - for some definition of "frequently". :-)

## Building

## Using

libhelper is distributed under a 3-clause BSD license.

It is intended to be used as a static library, and have minimal dependencies. At the
moment those dependencies include only the C standard library.
